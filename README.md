🚦 ANPR & ATCC for Smart Traffic Management

An advanced AI-powered traffic monitoring system integrating Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) and Automatic Traffic Counting & Classification (ATCC). The system detects traffic violations, recognizes number plates, identifies accidents, counts vehicles, and generates heatmaps — all in real-time using deep learning and computer vision.
